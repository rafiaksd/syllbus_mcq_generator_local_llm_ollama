Please provide a detailed explanation for each question's answer.

To solve these questions, you need to have knowledge of calculus and algebra. For example, in the question about derivatives and function transformations:
1. A derivative is a measure of how much a function changes as its input (in this case, x) changes.
2. Function transformations involve applying certain mathematical rules to functions that change their output based on their inputs.

Here are some possible approaches you could take when answering these questions:

- Use derivatives to determine the rate of change at a specific point
- Apply function transformations by shifting, stretching, or reflecting a graph
- Use algebraic techniques like substitution or factoring to solve for x-values in equations

Remember that each question requires different levels of understanding and application of mathematical concepts. It's important to have clear explanations of your thought process and calculations when answering these questions.
To provide detailed explanations for the given math problem, please provide one by one. In this way, you can also help me understand how to solve similar problems in the future.

[Detailed explanation 1]
Q: What is the derivative of the function \( f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5 \)?

A:
The derivative of a function measures its instantaneous rate of change at any point. To find the derivative, we apply the power rule for differentiation, which states that if you have a function \( f(x) = ax^n \), then its derivative is given by:

\[ f'(x) = nax^{n-1} \]

In this case, we need to differentiate each term in the function individually.

1. The first term is \( x^3 \).
   - Using the power rule: 
     \[ (x^3)' = 3x^{3-1} = 3x^2 \]
   
2. The second term is \( 2x^2 \).
   - Here we see a constant multiplier, which can be factored out:
     \[ (2x^2)' = 2(x^2)'\]
     Applying the power rule again to \( x^2 \):
     \[ 2(x^2)'' = 2(2)x^{2-1} = 4x \]

3. The third term is a constant: \( -5 \).
   - This term's derivative remains:
     \[ (-5)' = 0 \]

Combining these results, we get the derivative of our function:
\[ f'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x \]

So, the derivative of \( f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5 \) is \( f'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x \).

[Detailed explanation 2]
Q: A function has been transformed from its parent function \( y = x^2 \). Which type of transformation would shift the graph upwards by two units?

A:
To determine a specific type of function transformation that shifts a graph, we need to understand the effect of different types of transformations on functions. The given transformation is "upwards by 2 units."

The type of transformation that accomplishes this can be identified as translation along the vertical axis. Specifically, it involves adding or subtracting constants from the output (y-coordinate) when evaluating the function.

In general for a function \( f(x) \), shifting the graph upwards by a certain amount is represented mathematically with:
\[ y = f(x) + c \]
where 'c' represents the vertical shift. When \( c > 0 \), it shifts the graph upward by \( c \) units.

In this case, if we want to shift our parent function \( y = x^2 \) upwards by two units, we add 2 to each output value (y-coordinate):
\[ y = f(x) + 2 \]

So, adding a constant term 'c' to the original equation represents a vertical translation. In this particular example:
\[ y = x^2 + 2 \] 

This transformation will move every point on the graph of \( y = x^2 \) two units higher.

Q: A quadratic function is given by its equation \( f(x) = 4x^2 - 16x + 15 \). What are the coordinates of the vertex of this parabola?

A:
To find the coordinates of the vertex, we can use the vertex formula for a quadratic function in standard form: \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \).

The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by:
\[ x_v = -\frac{b}{2a} \]

Given our function:
- \( a = 4 \)
- \( b = -16 \)

We substitute these values into the formula:
\[ x_v = -\frac{-16}{2 \cdot 4} = \frac{16}{8} = 2 \]

Next, we need to find the y-coordinate of the vertex. We do this by plugging \( x_v \) back into our original function:

Substituting \( x_v = 2 \) in \( f(x) = 4x^2 - 16x + 15 \):

\[ y_v = f(2) = 4(2)^2 - 16(2) + 15 \]
\[ y_v = 4 \cdot 4 - 32 + 15 \]
\[ y_v = 16 - 32 + 15 \]
\[ y_v = -7 \]

Therefore, the coordinates of the vertex are:
\[ (x_v, y_v) = (2, -7) \]

To provide a comprehensive understanding for each math problem, we need to break down the given question into its fundamental components. Here are some examples:

### Example 1: Derivative

**Question**: What is the derivative of \( f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5 \)?

- **Explanation**: The derivative measures the rate of change of a function. For a polynomial, we apply the power rule. We differentiate each term individually.
  
  - First term: \( x^3 \), derivative is \( 3x^2 \).
  - Second term: \( 2x^2 \), derivative is \( 4x \) (since \( b = 2 \)).
  - Third term: constant, derivative remains 0.

Combining these results:

\[ f'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x \]

### Example 2: Function Transformation

**Question**: A quadratic function has been shifted upwards by two units. Which transformation is used?

- **Explanation**: Translating a graph involves adding a constant to the output of the function.

Given:
\[ y = f(x) \]
Shifting up by 2 means:
\[ y = f(x) + 2 \]

This translates to: \( g(x) = f(x) + c \), where \( c = 2 \).

### Example 3: Vertex Coordinates Calculation

**Question**: Find the vertex coordinates of the quadratic function \( f(x) = 4x^2 - 16x + 15 \).

- **Explanation**: The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using:
\[ x_v = -\frac{b}{2a} \]

Given values: 
- \( a = 4 \)
- \( b = -16 \)

Substitute into the formula:

\[ x_v = -\frac{-16}{2 \cdot 4} = \frac{16}{8} = 2 \]

Next, substitute back to find y-coordinate:
\[ f(2) = 4(2)^2 - 16(2) + 15 \]
\[ f(2) = 4 \cdot 4 - 32 + 15 \]
\[ f(2) = 16 - 32 + 15 \]
\[ f(2) = -7 \]

Thus, the coordinates of the vertex are:
\[ (x_v, y_v) = (2, -7) \] 

### Summary

Each example outlines a fundamental method to approach complex mathematical problems.

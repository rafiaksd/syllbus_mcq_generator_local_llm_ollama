    A[find Nearest City] --> B[London]
end 

In this solution, the `findNearestCity` function takes a list of locations and returns the name of the closest city to "London". It iterates through each location in the list, compares their code with London's code, and selects the one that is within a specified distance. The nearestCity variable will then hold the name of the closest city. 
The `mermaid` graph is a simple textual representation of the algorithm. In this case, we are using a textual representation because it is more intuitive for humans to understand the flow of the code and its purpose.
The `findNearestCity` function is the main algorithm that calculates the nearest city to "London". It iterates through each location in the list, compares their code with London's code, and selects the one that is within a specified distance. The function returns the name of the closest city. 
Note: This solution assumes that `Math.abs()` is used for comparing floating-point numbers. If it is not implemented correctly or if you need to compare integers instead, you can modify the code accordingly.
In this solution, we have created two functions - `findNearestCity` and `nearestCity`. The `findNearestCity` function takes a list of locations and returns the name of the closest city to "London". The `nearestCity` variable will hold the name of the closest city. 
The `mermaid` graph is a textual representation of the algorithm, which can be understood by humans instead of computers. In this case, we are using a graphical interface to represent the algorithm.
You can use this code as-is and make modifications as necessary to fit your specific requirements. You can also use it in different programming languages or environments, such as Node.js, Python, or JavaScript.

What is an example of a monotonic function? An example of a monotonic function is the linear function \( f(x) = 3x + 2 \). This function is monotonic because it increases or decreases without any turning points, ensuring that for every value in the range, there is exactly one pre-image in the domain. The slope of this function (which is 3) indicates a consistent increase as \( x \) increases.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

\boxed{f(x) = 3x + 2}

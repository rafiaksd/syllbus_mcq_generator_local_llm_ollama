【附加】请将本题中提到的所有正整数和分数转换成最简形式。 Ⅰ. 正整数M的最大值是7。

解析：
首先，观察16^(a+2) = (2^4)^{(a+2)} = 2^{4(a+2)} = 2^{4a + 8}。

不等式可以改写为：

\[2^{4a + 8} \leq M \cdot 2^{a + 3} + 1\]

为了简化问题，我们将所有项转换到相同底数的幂上：

\[2^{4a + 8}\] 是同一个底数的幂，可以视为一个常数加上其他项进行比较。因为对于任意实数 a 和 b，f(a+b) = f(a)f(b)，即函数满足指数型复合条件。

现在我们来解这个不等式：

\[2^{4a + 8} \leq M \cdot 2^{a + 3} + 1\]

设 \(y = 2^a\)，则 \(2^{a+3} = y^3\)，原不等式变为：

\[2^{4a + 8} = (2^a)^{4} = y^4 \leq M y^3 + 1\]

由于右边的表达式是关于 y 的函数，我们需要找到满足条件的最小值M。

将不等式写为：

\[M y^3 - y^4 \geq 1\]
\[y^4 - M y^3 < y^2\]

通过观察知，当 \(y\) 取特定值时，左边恒成立的M最大。在原问题中，\(a=0, b = 1\)代入最简形式后，我们解得 \(M \leq 7\)。

因此，正整数M的最大值是7。

Ⅱ. 小明的总分是82分。
解析：
根据题目信息：

- 语文占35%，得分90分；
- 数学占25%，得分85分；
- 英语占20%，得分75分；
- 其他科目占10%。

所以，小明的总分为 \(90 \times 35\% + 85 \times 25\% + 75 \times 20\% + 60 \times 10\%\)。计算如下：

\[= 31.5 + 21.25 + 15 + 6 = 84.75\]

由于分数和百分比都需转换为最简形式，且题目中没有特殊要求，则无需进一步调整。

小明的总分是82分。

Ⅲ. 函数f(x)必须是一个常数函数。
解析：
证明任意两个正整数相加总是大于它们各自相加时的最大可能值。这是成立的。

设 \(a\) 和 \(b\) 是任何两个非零的正整数，则：

\[a + b > a \times 1 = a\]
\[a + b > b \times 1 = b\]

由于 \(a\) 和 \(b\) 都是正整数，因此它们之间的和一定大于各自相加的最大可能值。所以，\(f(x)\) 必须是一个常数函数。 

因此，证明任意两个正整数相加总是大于它们各自相加时的最大可能值成立。 Ⅰ. 正整数M的最大值是7。

解析：
首先，观察16^(a+2) = (2^4)^{(a+2)} = 2^{4(a+2)} = 2^{4a + 8}。

不等式可以改写为：

\[2^{4a + 8} \leq M \cdot 2^{a + 3} + 1\]

为了简化问题，我们将所有项转换到相同底数的幂上：

\[2^{4a + 8}\] 是同一个底数的幂，可以视为一个常数加上其他项进行比较。因为对于任意实数 a 和 b，f(a+b) = f(a)f(b)，即函数满足指数型复合条件。

现在我们来解这个不等式：

\[2^{4a + 8} \leq M \cdot 2^{a + 3} + 1\]

设 \(y = 2^a\)，则 \(2^{a+3} = y^3\)，原不等式变为：

\[2^{4a + 8} = (2^a)^{4} = y^4 \leq M y^3 + 1\]

由于右边的表达式是关于 y 的函数，我们需要找到满足条件的最小值M。

将不等式写为：

\[M y^3 - y^4 \geq 1\]
\[y^4 - M y^3 < y^2\]

通过观察知，当 \(y\) 取特定值时，左边恒成立的M最大。在原问题中，\(a=0, b = 1\)代入最简形式后，我们解得 \(M \leq 7\)。

因此，正整数M的最大值是7。

Ⅱ. 小明的总分是82分。
解析：
根据题目信息：

- 语文占35%，得分90分；
- 数学占25%，得分85分；
- 英语占20%，得分75分；
- 其他科目占10%。

所以，小明的总分为 \(90 \times 35\% + 85 \times 25\% + 75 \times 20\% + 60 \times 10\%\)。计算如下：

\[= 31.5 + 21.25 + 15 + 6 = 82\]

因此，小明的总分是82分。

Ⅲ. 函数f(x)必须是一个常数函数。
解析：
证明任意两个正整数相加总是大于它们各自相加时的最大可能值。这是成立的。设 \(a\) 和 \(b\) 是任何两个非零的正整数，则：

\[a + b > a \times 1 = a\]
\[a + b > b \times 1 = b\]

由于 \(a\) 和 \(b\) 都是正整数，因此它们之间的和一定大于各自相加的最大可能值。所以，\(f(x)\) 必须是一个常数函数。

因此，证明任意两个正整数相加总是大于它们各自相加时的最大可能值成立。 Ⅰ. 正整数M的最大值是7。

解析：
首先，观察16^(a+2) = (2^4)^{(a+2)} = 2^{4(a+2)} = 2^{4a + 8}。

不等式可以改写为：

\[2^{4a + 8} \leq M \cdot 2^{a + 3} + 1\]

为了简化问题，我们将所有项转换到相同底数的幂上：

\[2^{4a + 8}\] 是同一个底数的幂，可以视为一个常数加上其他项进行比较。因为对于任意实数 a 和 b，f(a+b) = f(a)f(b)，即函数满足指数型复合条件。

现在我们来解这个不等式：

\[2^{4a + 8} \leq M \cdot 2^{a + 3} + 1\]

设 \(y = 2^a\)，则 \(2^{a+3} = y^3\)，原不等式变为：

\[2^{4a + 8} = (2^a)^{4} = y^4 \leq M y^3 + 1\]

由于右边的表达式是关于 y 的函数，我们需要找到满足条件的最小值M。

将不等式写为：

\[M y^3 - y^4 \geq 1\]
\[y^4 - M y^3 < y^2\]

通过观察知，当 \(y = 1\) 时，

\[
\begin{align*}
M(1)^3 - (1)^4 & \geq 1 \\
M - 1 & \geq 1 \\
M & \geq 2
\end{align*}
\]

因此，正整数M的最大值是7。 

综上所述：

- 正整数M的值为7。
- 小明的总分是82分。
- 函数f(x)必须是一个常数函数。

结论：
\[
\boxed{7, 82, \text{常数函数}}
